## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

"Travel With Catherine" is a project where I share my love for traveling and my photography portfolio. It contains images from various travel destinations that I have captured during my travels. The project is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## Gallery  <a id="gallery"></a>

You can explore my photography portfolio by visiting the `Gallery` section of the project. The images are organized by destination, and you can view a larger version of each image by clicking on it. You are free to use images in your own projects but do not claim them as yours. 

## Code  <a id="code"></a>
